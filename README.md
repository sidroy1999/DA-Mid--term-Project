Problem Statement:

The dataset contains information about customer attributes and their churn status. The goal is to predict customer churn using various machine learning models. Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses, and understanding factors contributing to it can help in devising strategies to retain customers.

Conclusion:

After exploring the dataset and training several machine learning models, the RandomForestClassifier appears to be the best-performing model for predicting customer churn. It achieved high accuracy (97.4%) and an impressive AUC score of 99.3%, indicating excellent predictive capability. Feature importance analysis suggests that factors such as call failure, subscription length, and customer value play significant roles in predicting churn. The dataset was also balanced using SMOTE to address the class imbalance issue. It's crucial for businesses to consider these insights when developing retention strategies to reduce customer churn.
